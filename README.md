# python-coding-progress-
For the two months that i spent studying to complete A level computer science, i chose to use python as my of language choice for my practical exam, and learnt basics to some moderately beginner code, this is the progress i made and what i learnt.

The basics involved Learning some simple code that would repeat throughout most of any programming that i could do, the early stages involved learning if statements, for and while loops and arrays.

Following this i learnt about sorting methods like linked lists, and how classes are implemented alongside functions and how to sub class under certain classes, as well as learning about how files function in programming. For this the earliest steps were to learn about queues and stacks, following with linkedlists, polymorphism and filehandling.

Reaching the closing end of what the syllabus required alongside my own personal curiosity in all of these sub sections of programming, i had to tackle some of the much more complicated programming sections, this involved getter setter, fuction overloading and a few different algorithms.

Nearing my exams i began completing past papers that required practical code with involved implementing all that i had learnt so far, the past papers were difficult to approach as they were incredibly different from what i had initially worked with prior, but after understanding the structure of the code i was building, as well as the questions themselves i eased into answering them.
